We offer our clients a comprehensive range of estate planning services with the primary objective on the structure and creation of fully integrated estate plans. Our attorneys have experience in drafting Wills, Trusts, power of attorney directives and Family Limited Partnerships. As part of this process, clients are guided through a full assessment of their estate and asset portfolio and assisted in their decisions about related issues, such as guardianship, beneficiary designations and fiduciary appointments. Special concern is paid to the needs and desires of clients to maintain control of family businesses through the estate process, as well as the protection of  those and other assets from potential creditors.

Other areas of practice include the administration of the probate process with the applicable probate court and related estate litigation.
