# Attorneys

this needs the attorney collection
The current site is out of order so I'm adding a sort to the front matter

For the attorney template, start with Matt (mdavis) to build the template.
Use the front matter of mattdavis.md to build header and image. I'm working on getting the other attorneys layout ot the same.
Here is the link to th original page: http://www.jonesdavis.com/bios/Davis.htm
* Note the Practice group which is a collection.
* Note States Licensed in is also a collection. No sort
* Ignore tagLine and listImage in front matter, it's for the next iteration
