* Evaluation of lender relationships in order to determine the best fit for the church client.
* Permanent loan financing including the refinance of existing debt structures (construction debt or other existing debt).
* Revolving line of credit (for operational needs).
* Negotiation of financing terms including:
    * scope of pledged collateral (assets, land, buildings, life insurance)
    * partial release of collateral covenants (with debt paydowns)
    * terms of repayment/amortization (awareness of market conditions)
    * default and cure provisions
    * interest rate
    * prepayment penalty points/fees
    * closing costs
    * recourse debt vs. non-recourse
* Evaluation of the type of financing that best fits the needs of the church project such as:   * conventional debt (asset based) financing vs. non-conventional (bonds/pledges)
